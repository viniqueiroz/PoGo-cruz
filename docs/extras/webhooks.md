# Webhooks

RocketMap can send map information such as Pokémon spawns, gym details, raid appearances and pokestop lures to other applications through webhooks.

Every time a webhook-enabled event occurs (for example a new Pokémon appearing) a web request will be sent to a provided URL containing information about that event.

## What Do Webhooks Do?

Webhooks allow developers to send data from RocketMap to other applications.

A simple example would be an application that receives Pokémon spawn events, checks if the Pokémon that's appeared is a Dragonite, and if so plays an alarm sound.

## Setting Up a Webhook

To start sending data to a webhook:
1. set a webhook url (or list of webhook urls) to send data to
2. set the webhook types to be received
3. (optional) set up a whitelist or blacklist

**If no webhook types are set, no webhook data will be sent.**

### Setting webhook URLs

#### Using the command line

Add `-wh http://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL` to your existing command line.

To send data to multiple URLs, add a new `-wh ...` string for each URL, for example:
```
-wh http://YOUR_FIRST_WEBHOOK_URL -wh http://YOUR_SECOND_WEBHOOK_URL
```

#### Using a config file

Add a new line to your config file:
```
webhook: http://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

To send data to multiple URLs, use an array:
```
webhook: [ http://YOUR_FIRST_WEBHOOK_URL, http://YOUR_SECOND_WEBHOOK_URL ]
```

### Setting webhook types

#### Using the command line

Add `--wh-types WEBHOOK_TYPE` to your existing command line.

To set multiple webhook types, add a new `--wh-types ...` string for each URL, for example:
```
--wh-types pokemon --wh-types raid
```

#### Using a config file

Add a new line to your config file:
```
wh-types: WEBHOOK_TYPE
```

To set multiple webhook types, use an array:
```
wh-types: [ pokemon, raid ]
```

### Filtering Pokémon

To limit the Pokémon that get sent to webhooks you can:
* whitelist specific Pokémon IDs, **or**
* blacklist specific Pokémon IDs

**If you use a whitelist you cannot also use a blacklist (and vice-versa).**

You can whitelist/blacklist Pokémon IDs using either a list or a file. You can use **either** a list **or** a file, but **not both**.

#### Whitelisting Pokémon

If you want to send webhook data for specific Pokémon (and no other Pokémon) you can use a Pokémon whitelist.

**Using a string**

You can a string of Pokémon IDs to whitelist using:
```
webhook-whitelist: [ POKEMON_ID_1, POKEMON_ID_2, POKEMON_ID_3 ]
```

**Using a file**

You can set a whitelist file using:
```
webhook-whitelist-file: WHITELIST_FILE
```

Note: each Pokémon ID must be on a new line.

**Example**

Whitelisting Dratini, Dragonair, Dragonite, Larvitar, Pupitar and Tyranitar using a whitelist array:

`config.ini`:
```
webhook-whitelist: [ 147, 148, 149, 246, 247, 248 ]
```

#### Blacklisting Pokémon

If you want to exclude specific Pokémon from being set to webhooks you can use a Pokémon blacklist.

**Using a string**

You can a string of Pokémon IDs to blacklist using:
```
webhook-blacklist: [ POKEMON_ID_1, POKEMON_ID_2, POKEMON_ID_3 ]
```

**Using a file**

You can set a blacklist file using:
```
webhook-blacklist-file: BLACKLIST_FILE
```
Note: each Pokémon ID must be on a new line.

**Example**

Blacklisting Pidgey, Spearow, Caterpie and Weedle using a blacklist file:

`config.ini`:
```
webhook-blacklist-file: pokemon-blacklist.txt
```

`pokemon-blacklist.txt`:
```
10
13
16
21
```

## Webhook Types

Data is sent to webhooks as a JSON object containing an array of webhook events.

Each webhook event has the structure:
```
{
  "type":    EVENT_TYPE,
  "message": EVENT_DATA
}
```

For example:
```
[
  {
    "type":    "pokemon",
    "message": { ... }
  },
  {
    "type":    "pokemon",
    "message": { ... }
  },
  {
    "type":    "pokemon",
    "message": { ... }
  },
  {
    "type":    "gym",
    "message": { ... }
  }
]
```

RocketMap currently provides the following webhook types: [`pokemon`](#pokemon), [`pokestop`](#pokestop), [`lure`](#lure), [`gym`](#gym), [`gym-info`](#gym-info), [`egg`](#egg), [`raid`](#raid), [`tth`](#tth), [`captcha`](#captcha). Please note that as RocketMap evolves more webhook types may be added.

If you are a developer please feel free to contribute new webhook types through the usual [RocketMap development process](https://github.com/RocketMap/RocketMap/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code).

The sections below outline the different webhook types and the data that gets sent for each event.

### `gym-info`

A `gym-info` event is sent whenever RocketMap fetches a gym's details.

**Important: while the webhook type name for `gym-info` events is `gym-info`, when this data is sent to a webhook the `type` field will be `gym_details`.**

| Field         | Details                                                | Example                 |

### `egg`

An `egg` event is sent whenever RocketMap detects that an egg has appeared at a gym.

**Important: while the webhook type name for `egg` events is `egg`, when this data is sent to a webhook the `type` field will be `raid`.**

Note: `egg` events use the same event type and fields as `raid` events, but the Pokémon-specific fields such as `pokemon_id` will be `null`.

| Field        | Details                                                           | Example      |

### `raid`

A `raid` event is sent whenever RocketMap detects that a raid has started at a gym.

Note: `raid` events use the same event type and fields as `egg` events, but the Pokémon-specific fields such as `pokemon_id` will be populated.

| Field        | Details                                                           | Example      |

### `tth`

A `tth` event is sent whenever a scan instance's TTH completion status changes by more than 1%.

**Important: while the webhook type name for `tth` events is `tth`, when this data is sent to a webhook the `type` field will be `scheduler`.**

Note: at present only the `speed-scan` scheduler sends `tth` events.

| Field          | Details                                                     | Example       |

| `name`         | The type of scheduler which performed the update            | `"SpeedScan"` |
| `instance`     | The status name of scan instance which performed the update |  `"New York"` |
| `tth_found`    | The completion status of the TTH scan                       |      `0.9965` |
| `spawns_found` | The number of spawns found in this update                   |           `5` |

### `captcha`

A `captcha` event is sent whenever a scan worker encounters a captcha.

| Field         | Details                                                   | Example           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `status_name` | The status name of the account which received the captcha |      `"New York"` |
| `account`     | The name of the account that received the captcha         | `"silverwind268"` |
| `status`      | The captchas status<sup>1</sup>                           |       `"success"` |

| `time`        | The time taken to resolve the captcha                     |              `11` |

## PokeAlarm

[PokeAlarm](https://github.com/RocketMap/PokeAlarm) is an application which can be used to send alerts for various events.

PokeAlarm receives data from RocketMap through webhooks, processes and filters the data, and can then send event-specific alerts through messaging services such as Twitter and Discord.

A full list of the events PokeAlarm can provide alerts for, as well as the messaging services that can be used, can be found in the [PokeAlarm wiki](https://github.com/RocketMap/PokeAlarm/wiki).

## RocketMap Public Webhook

RocketMap is collecting data for an upcoming project. If you would like to help our efforts please fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/ZCx6mQNngr0bAvRY2). You will then receive an email with a webhook url which you can add to your list of webhooks.
